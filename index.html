            <li><h3 class = "font">Gryffindor</li></h3>
            <p>Gryffindors are associated with daring, bravery, nerve and chivalry. Gryffindors can be cocky and reckless; 
            they are more prone to saying something or getting into a hairy situation before thinking it through than 
            other Hogwarts houses.</p>

            <li><h3 class = "font">Hufflepuff</li></h3>
            <p>Hufflepuffs are associated with trustworthiness, loyalty, and a strong work ethic. 
            Hufflepuff has produced the fewest Dark witches and wizards of any House. </p>

            <li><h3 class = "font">Ravenclaw</li></h3>
            <p>Ravenclaws possess the traits of cleverness, wisdom, wit, intellectual ability and creativity. According to Slytherin 
            prefect Gemma Farley, Ravenclaws are so competitive when it comes to academic success that they are known to back stab 
            each other, and likely other students, in order to get top marks. Many well-known inventors and innovators have come 
            from Ravenclaw.</p>

            <li><h3 class = "font">Slytherin</li></h3>
            <p>Slytherins are associated with cunning, ambition and a tendency to look after their own.
            Slytherin has produced its share of Dark witches and wizards, but members are not afraid to admit it. </p>
